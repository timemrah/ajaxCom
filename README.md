# ajaxCom
Backend (PHP)  frontend(Javascript) ajax communication tool.

A simple way to manage the Ajax process result by the PHP server.

If we already make the necessary form controls on the front-end side, we have to do the same controls with the back-end.

Also, we don't just do ajax for the form.

We need this structure when we want to manage Ajax results simply on the server side.
